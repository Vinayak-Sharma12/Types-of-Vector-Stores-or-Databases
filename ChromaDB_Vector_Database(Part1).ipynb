and estuaries. \\nThey play a vital role in regulating the planet\\'s climate, producing oxygen, and supporting biodiversity. \\nCoral reefs, often called the \"rainforests of the sea,\" are home to thousands of species but are under threat from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. \\nConservation efforts include marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and international agreements to reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\nHistory of the Olympic Games\\nThe Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece around 776 BCE as a festival honoring Zeus. \\nThe modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin, featuring athletes from multiple nations competing in various sports. \\nThe Games have evolved into a global event held every four years, with both Summer and Winter editions. \\nThey serve not only as a platform for athletic excellence but also as a symbol of international unity and cultural exchange.']\n"
