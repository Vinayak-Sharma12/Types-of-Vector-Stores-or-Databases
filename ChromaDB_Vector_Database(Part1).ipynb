            "In 1956, the Dartmouth Conference marked the official birth of AI as a field. Over the decades, AI research has gone through cycles of optimism, funding booms, and periods known as \"AI winters\" where interest waned due to limited progress. \n",
            "Key milestones include the development of expert systems in the 1970s, the rise of machine learning in the 1990s, and the explosion of deep learning in the 2010s. Today, AI is applied in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and decision-making systems across industries.\n",

and estuaries. \\nThey play a vital role in regulating the planet\\'s climate, producing oxygen, and supporting biodiversity. \\nCoral reefs, often called the \"rainforests of the sea,\" are home to thousands of species but are under threat from climate change, pollution, and overfishing. \\nConservation efforts include marine protected areas, sustainable fishing practices, and international agreements to reduce carbon emissions.\\n\\nHistory of the Olympic Games\\nThe Olympic Games originated in ancient Greece around 776 BCE as a festival honoring Zeus. \\nThe modern Olympic Games were revived in 1896 by Pierre de Coubertin, featuring athletes from multiple nations competing in various sports. \\nThe Games have evolved into a global event held every four years, with both Summer and Winter editions. \\nThey serve not only as a platform for athletic excellence but also as a symbol of international unity and cultural exchange.']\n"
